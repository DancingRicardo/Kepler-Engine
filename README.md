## Important notes

1. Uses Raylib. Get it however you wish, though a solution file is included for raylib as well. You may need to do some extra things to get it running. 

2. Whenever you make new files, you MUST run the premake.exe file. It is **required** for it to compile. This is due to the way the project is set up, it allows for a quicker start (no linking) but it makes it annoying to do anything. 

## Steps to start out

1. Clone repo.
